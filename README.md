Deep Neural Networks (DNN): The main architecture of the model has been constructed using deep neural networks. This constitutes a typical neural network structure consisting of input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

Linear and Regularized Regression: L2 regularization has been applied for each hidden layer in the model. This helps to mitigate overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model.

Training-Validation Split: The data has been divided into training and validation sets. The training set is used to learn the parameters of the model, whereas the validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Optimization Algorithms: A range of optimization algorithms have been used to compare their performance. These algorithms include Adam, SGD, Adadelta, among others.

Data Normalization: The data has been scaled using the Min-Max normalization method. This can aid in faster and better learning of the model by squeezing each feature value into a specific range.

Plots and Visualizations: Matplotlib has been used to plot metrics such as training accuracy, training loss, validation accuracy, and validation loss for tracking the training process of the model.

Confusion Matrix and Performance Metrics: A confusion matrix and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score have been employed to evaluate the classification performance of the model.

These techniques represent typical methods used in a general machine learning project. In this example, all stages of the process, including data analysis, model building, model training, model evaluation, and interpretation of results, have been covered.
